The RingCentral Hubspot integration enhances HubSpot with a full-featured phone and dialer, allowing Hubspot users to send and receive phone calls from directly within Hubspot, as well as providing them with the following features:

* Click-to-call contacts
* Call-pop for inbound calls
* Capture call notes for all received calls
* Sync call logs with Hubspot
* Send/receive SMS
* Schedule video meetings
* and more. 

The RingCentral Hubspot integration is built on top of [RingCentral Embeddable](https://developers.ringcentral.com/embeddable-voice.html), an open-source project to enable developers to easily embed a RingCentral phone into any webpage. The [RingCentral Hubspot integration is open-source](https://github.com/ringcentral/hubspot-embeddable-ringcentral-phone) itself, and is free to developers to modify and enhance independently.
